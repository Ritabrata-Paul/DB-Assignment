1. The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities in the ERD is one-to-many.
  a. A Product belongs to one Product Category. This means each product can only be categorized under one product category.
  b. A Product Category can have many Products. This means a single product category can have many products associated with it.
  The "Product" table has a column named "category_id" which is a foreign key referencing the primary key ("id") of the "Product_Category" table.

2. There are several ways to ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it:

  a. Database Constraints:

      Foreign Key Constraint: This is the approach already implemented in the ERD you described. The "Product" table has a "category_id" foreign key referencing the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. This prevents products from being added with non-existent category IDs.

  b. Data Validation on Entry:

      Form Validation: When adding or editing products through a user interface (web form, application), implement validation rules to ensure the selected category exists. This can be done through code checks or dropdown menus pre-populated with valid categories.
      API Validation: If you're using an API to add or update products, implement validation logic on the server-side to check if the provided category ID corresponds to an existing category before finalizing the product creation/update.

  c. Business Logic and Rules:

      Default Category: Define a default "Uncategorized" category in the "Product_Category" table. If a product is added without an explicit category selection, assign it the default category ID by default. This prevents products from being completely missing a category association.
      Data Integrity Checks: Implement periodic database checks to identify products with invalid category IDs. These checks can flag products for correction or automatically set them to the default category. 

  d. Data Seeding and Management:

    Pre-populate Categories: Ensure your "Product_Category" table has all the necessary categories before allowing product creation. This minimizes the chance of users accidentally assigning non-existent categories.
    Category Management Tools: Provide tools for managing product categories, including adding, editing, and deactivating categories. This allows for maintaining a clean and up-to-date list of valid categories.
